## GPS configuration for NMEA messages

Instructions directly from the SW Developer of RaceChrono in the support forum point out [here](https://racechrono.com/forum/discussion/comment/11252/#Comment_11252) and [here](https://racechrono.com/forum/discussion/1421/best-settings-for-qstarz818xt)

- Sentences need to start with `$GP`
- Only `GGA+RMC` or `RMC+VTG+ZDA` combinations are used
- `GSA+GSV` are optional
- `GBS` sentence is not used

This means

- Main Talker ID = GP
- `GSA` and `GSV` every 5 seconds, with only `GSV` restricted to GP
